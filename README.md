# wirereader
The intent of this project was to develop a PYTHON CLI program to parse Wireshark outputs and resolve Human Readable Logs from packet information. 

WIP

It didn't quite decode payload what I intended, but the results are still fun.

Simply download and unzip the package.

Be sure to change your filepath to the correct output folder of your Wireshark or other packet sniffer logs inside of 'wirereader.py'.

If everything is correct, click 'run.bat' inside of root folder.

The program should run automatically and output a nice log.
